<p>providing lifelong support and development for writers<br/>
<br/>
Since January 1989 we have been helping  writers to develop their craft and learn how to navigate the complexities of the publishing world. We have created a suite of courses that anyone – regardless of age or educational background – can use to guide them through their writing apprenticeship.

All our tutors are professional writers, experienced at giving expert advice and feedback through the assignments you will complete with your course.

Everyone at WB, from the tutors, student advisors and administration team aim to establish a warm and friendly relationship with each and every student. This helps to make the WB community a welcoming and safe place to develop your writing skills.
