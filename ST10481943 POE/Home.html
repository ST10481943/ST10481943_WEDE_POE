The organisation I have chosen is an NPO that provides resources and support for writers, including courses, workshops, and competitions.Â This Writer Bureau Centre supports not only up and coming writers but also experienced writers and authors with tools to improve their writing as well as networking opportunities that allow them to be mentored by other more experienced writers, and this allows them to explore different styles or methods of writing to not only increase their exposure but their potential target market as well. The target market is writers of all ages and demographics but mostly focusing on helping people from disadvantages backgrounds and providing a stepping stone and allowing them to have equal opportunities.
